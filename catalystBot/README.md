### What can you build?

It all depends on what your needs are. Use integrations to tie systems together, customize employee onboarding, reinforce cultural rituals, and send out those TPS reports everyone loves.

### Simple building blocks

Internal integrations can do what Slack apps can do. Internal integrations are Slack apps. They just integrate with the stuff you want them to.

- Incoming webhooks provide the easiest way to send a message or notification. And you can make them interactive too. Perfect for cron jobs, batch scripts, or invoking from your internal bug trackers, build systems, and other process management tools.
- Bot users are a special kinds of users that observe & respond to conversational interactions in channels and direct messages. They are usually powered by a combination of the Web API and the Events API or the RTM API. Make work human again.
- Slash commands are triggered by users from within Slack. They're ideal for invoking actions like filing bug reports, initiating a deploy, or building ways to check in on the current health of your systems.
- The Web API is a collection of HTTP RPC methods for reading, writing, and transforming data and messages on Slack. You can do a little bit of everything and it's like the glue that binds a reasonably complex Slack app together.
- The Events and RTM APIs allow your app to receive data around a team in near real time. With the RTM API, your server opens a websocket connection with Slack and receives a firehose of data. With the Events API, Slack sends your server HTTP requests for each event you're subscribed to.

### Easy installation

When you're building just for your team, installing a Slack app is as easy clicking an install button. No one needs to learn OAuth if they don't want to.

Of course, OAuth is still here for you when you need it and you don't have to distribute your app to other teams to use it.

Sign in with Slack is one way to allow your team members to sign in to an internal application with their Slack credentials.
